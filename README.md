# Elevate Labs Internship â€“ Day 1
# Task: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

I worked on cleaning and preprocessing the "Medical Appointment No-Shows" dataset from Kaggle. Below are the steps I followed:

  **1. Improved Readability**
    - Turned off Excel gridlines (Alt + W, V, G) for a cleaner view.
    - Inserted a blank column to the left of the dataset for better spacing, then resized column width to 1.15 (Alt + H, O, W).

  **2. Data Formatting**
    - Focused on columns D and E (date-related fields).
    - Used Ctrl + H to replace:
      > "Z" â†’ "" (blank)
      > "T" â†’ " " (space)
    - This ensured the values were converted into a proper date-time format.
      
  **3. Styling for Clarity**
    - Applied borders to the dataset.
    - Made headers bold and added background color for better separation from raw data.

ðŸ“Œ For reference, I have included both "Raw_Data" and "Transformed_Data" in the Excel file.
